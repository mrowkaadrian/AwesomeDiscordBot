# Welcome to my Discord BOT!

Are you tired of high latency **public music bots**? This one was created because of those.  

Now you can host your own and share music you like with your friends on the server!

## Configuration

- Install Node.js on your device:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

- Create your own bot on official discord page:
https://discord.com/developers/applications

- Clone this repository

- Create file named 'config.json' inside source directory

- replace YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE with actual token and put inside 'config.json':

```javascript
{
  "token": "YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE"
}
```

- run this app with 'node index.js'
